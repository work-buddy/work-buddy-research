## Do we need to make our own headset?

Let's evaluate...

We **need** raw camera access to create custom XR software. This is an unmovable fact.

### Which headsets allow raw camera access?

Quest 3 - **NO**

Meta CTO thoughts verify Work Buddy dream:


> "The serious answer is we can all imagine phenomenally useful use cases if a developer has direct access to 
the camera. You're a mechanic and you're looking at an engine that you're not familiar with and a developer
could build the types of tools to help you see the overlays in the schematic, even diagnose the problem.
**Meta is never going to build that**, and the developer can't upload to us every possible configuration of image that we might see for us to build a classifier on, that's not credible either. That's a use case that goes underserved if you don't build out the capability." - Meta CTO
