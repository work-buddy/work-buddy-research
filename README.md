## Do we need to make our own headset?

Let's evaluate...

We **need** raw camera access to create custom XR software. This is an unmovable fact.

### Which headsets allow raw camera access?

Quest 3 - **NO / NOT YET**

Meta CTO thoughts verify Work Buddy dream:


> "The serious answer is we can all imagine phenomenally useful use cases if a developer has direct access to 
the camera. **You're a mechanic and you're looking at an engine** that you're not familiar with and a developer
could build the types of tools to help you see the overlays in the schematic, even diagnose the problem." - Meta CTO

> "**Meta is never going to build that**, and the developer can't upload to us every possible configuration of image that we might see for us to build a classifier on, that's not credible either. That's a use case that goes underserved if you don't build out the capability." - Meta CTO

Apple Vision  - **MAYBE / ENTERPRISE PRIVATE ACCESS ONLY**  
https://www.uploadvr.com/apple-vision-pro-enterprise-raw-camera-access/

> "Today at WWDC Apple announced Enterprise APIs for visionOS 2, which will give businesses access to advanced features not available in consumer apps." 

Amazing news Apple! But...

> "Apple makes clear that these features can only be used in apps **"for use in a business setting only"**, and apps using them can only be distributed as proprietary in-house apps or custom apps made for a specific business using **Apple Business Manager**, *not on the App Store*. A *managed entitlement is required*, alongside a license file tied to your Apple *developer account*."

Major headache, always at the whim of being shutdown whenever Apple feels like. We cannot tolerate any risks to our product or ask permission to make new technology.
